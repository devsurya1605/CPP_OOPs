# Static Balance Tracker

## Overview
Create a `BankAccount` class that simulates a simple bank account. The class should have the following features:

- A static data member `totalBalance` to keep track of the total balance across all accounts.
- A constructor that takes an initial balance as a parameter and updates `totalBalance` accordingly.

## Requirements
There are 2 `BankAccounts` in the Bank. Given the balance of both accounts as input, create the objects using the constructor to update `totalBalance` and print the total balance of the Bank.

## Input Format
- The first line contains 2 integers representing the balances of the bank accounts.

## Output Format
- Print the value of `totalBalance`.
